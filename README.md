# 🛍️ ShopNest – React Shopping Website

Welcome to **ShopNest**, a sleek and responsive e-commerce web app built with **React** and styled using **CSS**. This project was designed not just to simulate a modern shopping experience, but also to deepen my understanding of **React Hooks** and **Redux** for state management.

## 🧠 Learning Focus

This project was a hands-on deep dive into:
- **React Hooks**: mastering lifecycle and state logic without classes  
- **Redux**: implementing a scalable state architecture for complex UI flows  
- Component reusability and modular design
